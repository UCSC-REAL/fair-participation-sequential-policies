#+title: Readme

- adult.py generates a set of achievable loss vectors.

TODO: other datasets

- dual.py generates publication figure that explains how RRM can fail
- run_problems.py generates three-panel figures of losses, rhos, and loss-surface,
          and how these values update according to the proposed methods
  + RRM
  + RRM with rho_hat (to be performatively optimal)
  + The proposed intervention for fairness + optimality
